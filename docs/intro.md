# Veclite

**Veclite** is a lightweight and versatile Rust crate designed to serve as an efficient alternative to the standard `Vec` collection. It extends the familiar API with added conveniences and enhanced formatting capabilities, making it especially useful in scenarios where structured output and display formatting are important.

Unlike `Vec`, Veclite comes with built-in support for `std::fmt::Display`, enabling easy and customizable string representations out of the box. This feature makes Veclite ideal for logging, debugging, and any use case that benefits from readable and structured output of vector-like data.

Veclite aims to maintain simplicity and performance, staying close to the standard vector behavior while introducing subtle improvements that make it a useful drop-in replacement. Whether you're building CLI tools, data processing pipelines, or educational examples, Veclite gives you more expressive control without adding unnecessary complexity.
